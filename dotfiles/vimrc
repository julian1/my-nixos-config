" *********** TOGGLE INSERT/MODE ****************
" Must use the Ctrl otherwise it will screw up copy and paste into buffer,
" i to insert, ii to escape
" inoremap ii <Esc>   " ii key is <Esc> setting

"ctrl-i is a lot easier than ctrl-c since uses two hands and is symetrical with i for insert mode

set number

" don't blink

set ruler

" tell us when anything is changed via :...

" need doc on all other keys
" C u - up
" C d - down
" C j - join lower line with current line 
" C i - seems not to be overloadable as interferes with tab expansion
" C n	next tab
" C p	prev tab
" C m	buffer menu

" this is really nice for fast navigating, duplicates existing keys

" *********** TABS ****************
" tab navigation like firefox
" works very well - use ctrl-n and ctrl-p correspond to :bn and :bp - for next and previous buffervim
" just use ctrl-t to create new tab then :e file to open file
" likewise ctrl-w to close the tab
" but note
" # CTRL+T is used for jumping to previous tags [exuberant ctags].
" # CTRL+W is used for jumping to next split window in multiple windows
""""" tabnext and tab previous defalts are gt and gT
"" not sure if shouldnt use defaults instead
" note that tabf is best way to open tab
