OK- issue is now the tests... 
  - or maybe as a dependency...

[nix-shell:~/nixos-config/nix/network-transport-tcp]$ nix-build
these derivations will be built:
  /nix/store/rgvy6b9qwg73gr7bapf69q2p5rr3q368-network-transport-tests-0.2.4.2.drv
  /nix/store/lgl1bvy4mnh4drl38vsmvjdwv2j6w6ws-network-transport-tcp-0.6.0.drv
building '/nix/store/rgvy6b9qwg73gr7bapf69q2p5rr3q368-network-transport-tests-0.2.4.2.drv'...

Build with /nix/store/hg3na12737n7wws1kndxvs95ai88fgn8-ghc-8.6.5.



---------------------
So i think we want to find the original nix for network-transport-tcp 
  and copy it.

  eg. it's not in the package itself. 

-----------

simple xmonad/dmenu configuration.nix in nixos
  scroll down.
  https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/75333


-------------
done - /etc/bashrc reads the following.
  So we should just be able to write this...

  # Read system-wide modifications.
  if test -f /etc/bashrc.local; then
      . /etc/bashrc.local
  fi



-----------


done - fixed screen - when started in nix-shell, the bash shell does not have the shellHook, and so looses all aliases/and prompt
  can manually just import,
 
  start screen. then 
  [me@nixos03:~/my-nixos-config]$ . ./dotfiles/bash_aliases 
  me@nixos03:~/my-nixos-config$ 


done - fixed. vim is sprawing swp swo files everywhere

done - fixed. screen has a startup screen
